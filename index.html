    <p>Hey Javier! Here's your deep dive guide to getting better at CS2. Level up your skills and dominate the match.</p>

    <section id="aiming">
      <h2>Aiming</h2>
      <p>Javier, mastering aim takes daily repetition. Use Aim Lab, Kovaak's, or CS2 workshop maps like Aim Botz and Fast Aim Reflex. Focus on crosshair placement — always aim at head level, and keep your crosshair where an enemy might peek. Try deathmatch with rifles only to improve flicks and tracking. Spend 10–15 minutes daily just warming up your aim before matchmaking.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="movement">
      <h2>Movement</h2>
      <p>Clean movement gives you a tactical advantage. Practice counter-strafing: tap the opposite movement key just before shooting to regain accuracy quickly. Learn to crouch peek, shoulder peek, and jump throw grenades. Movement drills on workshop maps will help you move more efficiently and confidently under pressure.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="map">
      <h2>Map Knowledge</h2>
      <p>Javier, knowing your surroundings is key. Watch pro players and learn callouts for every map — especially those you play most. Use smoke practice maps to learn effective smoke, flash, and molotov lineups. Understand where players usually hide, and pre-aim those angles. The more you study a map, the more you control it.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="teamplay">
      <h2>Teamplay</h2>
      <p>Even solo queue warriors need teamwork. Use your mic, give clear callouts, and be a positive voice in your team. Learn how to trade kills — if your teammate pushes, be close enough to follow up. Play support when needed — don't always go for the top frag. Smart utility usage (like flashing for an entry or smoking off angles) makes a huge impact.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="settings">
      <h2>Settings</h2>
      <p>Find what works for you, Javier. Most pros use 400–800 DPI with low in-game sensitivity for precision. Turn off mouse acceleration and set a crosshair that’s visible but not distracting. Video settings should prioritize visibility and high FPS. Customize your radar to show more of the map and enable net_graph to monitor performance during games.</p>

    <p>Stay sharp, Javier. Consistency, patience, and smart practice are the keys to ranking up in CS2. GLHF!</p>
